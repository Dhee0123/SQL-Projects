Pizza Hut Sales Analysis Using SQL

In this project, SQL was used to analyze Pizza Hut's sales data to derive valuable business insights. The dataset includes details on sales transactions, customer demographics, product information, and store locations. The analysis focuses on the following key areas:

Sales Overview: Calculating total sales, average sales per order, and total number of transactions over a specific period.
SQL queries were written to extract total sales (SUM()), and total transactions (COUNT()).

Customer Analysis: Segmenting customers based on demographics such as age, location, and order frequency. SQL joins and GROUP BY were used to create customer segments and analyze their purchasing patterns.

Top-Selling Items: Identifying the most popular menu items based on sales volume. GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses were used to rank items by total sales, along with filters to see trends over time.

Time-Based Trends: Analyzing sales trends over time to identify peak hours, days, and seasons. JOINs for combining data from multiple tables (sales, products, customers, and stores).
Aggregations (SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()) to summarize sales metrics. GROUP BY and ORDER BY to analyze data by different dimensions such as product, location, and time. WHERE filters to target specific subsets of data, such as time periods or customer segments. Window functions (RANK()) for ranking and cumulative calculations.

This SQL-based analysis provided actionable insights for optimizing Pizza Hut's operations, improving marketing efforts, and boosting overall profitability.
